# ========================================================
# Whitelist Strategy: Ignore everything by default,
# then un-ignore specific file types and essential files.
# ========================================================

# Step 1: Ignore everything in the project root and subdirectories.
*

# Step 2: Un-ignore (whitelist) specific files that should ALWAYS be tracked.
# The '!' character means "do not ignore".
!/.gitignore
!/app.py
!/utilities/config.py # Assuming you have this file for configuration

# Step 3: Un-ignore all directories so Git can look inside them.
# We need this to find the files we want to keep.
!*/

# Step 4: Whitelist file extensions for source code.
# Un-ignore all files ending with these extensions in any directory.
!**/*.py
!**/*.html
!**/*.css
!**/*.js

# Step 5: Explicitly ignore things we NEVER want to track,
# even if they match the extensions above (as a safeguard).
